# Bike-Share-Data
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.  Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

## Overview
In this project, I will explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, I will write a code import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing <b>descriptive statistics</b>. I will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## What Software Do I Need?
To complete this project, i'll require the following softwares:

- Python 
- A text editor, like Sublime or Atom
- A terminal application

## The Datasets
The datasets provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider in the US, contains randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. The data files for all three cities contain the same core six columns:

- Start Time 
- End Time 
- Trip Duration 
- Start Station 
- End Station 
- User Type 

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

- Gender
- Birth Year
